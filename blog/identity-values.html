     <h4>Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values</h4>
      <p>Authenticity:
       <br> There is importance in living one’s truth in accordance to one’s sense of personality, ideals and spirit, irrespective of the pressures that challenge one’s integrity. I find value in the act of being honest with oneself and the relationships we form, and being accountable for the actions we take.
      </p>
      <p>Self-Growth:
        <br>To be able to contribute positively in society, it is essential to work on oneself and the extension of that will radiate consequentially.  
      </p>
      <p>Respect:
        <br>Irrespective of a person's actions or words, I strive to accept and avoid judging individuals by their characteristics, attitude towards life and their behaviours.
      </p>
          
         
      
           
      
      
     <h4>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make</h4>
     <i class="fa-solid fa-paw"></i>
      <p>I recently adopted Mochi, a shelter rescue cat. 
        Knowing cats were obligate carnivores, meant that in order for them to meet their nutritional needs, they would need to consume other animals. This was challenging for me because many years ago, I had made the decision to stop my consumption of meat for ethical, environmental and health reasons. Though, Mochi alone was another natural carnivore, who am I to impose those rationales on to him? Nevertheless, as a cat guardian, I had to ensure Mochi’s needs were met. 
        </p>
      <h4>How you weighed up the values involved in that decision</h4>
        <p>To ensure I was making the best decision for Mochi, it was important I educated myself and conducted some extensive research regarding the optimum nutrition for felines. This meant I had to keep an open-mind, remain authentic in my objectives for the research conducted, and select literature and content that were credible; those that gave me a holistic view of feline health (as oppose to feeling skewed towards material that might have suggested that cats could thrive on plant-foods). 
          <br>
          Inevitably, it was important to respect the natural diet of a cat and provide Mochi with nutritionally rich meals. Thus, if Mochi was going to consume a heavily meat-based diet, there was no reason that I could not source fresh foods that have qualities of being environmentally-friendly and closest to ethically-raised. 
          <br>
          While it took some time for me to process, once I was fully informed about Mochi’s dietary ratios and found suppliers that aligned with the qualities I was satisfied with, I was ready to put my personal morals aside and whip up a hearty meal for Mochi.   
        </p>
     <h4>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity</h4>
        <p>
          Having direct exposure to both individualistic and collectivistic cultures, I was given the privileged opportunity to explore and appreciate multifaceted perspectives. 
          <br>
          As a result, these perspectives have taught me to value the importance of growth within oneself. Individuals and communities have their own ideologies, structures and sense of what is right or wrong. This notion has reminded me to treat apparent discrepancies in my daily life with respect, to be present and to remain inquisitive because there is always a lesson to be learnt. Super cliche, but humbling when it comes to it! 
          <br>
          While it is important to respect differences and have an open-mind, being authentic and having integrity in oneself is as important. There are instances where I feel tested in stifling situations, though having the essence of these values ground me, and reminds me who I choose to be in every moment. 
        </p>

      <h4>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h4>
        <p>
          Maintaining an open-mind and adopting both an empathetic and logical approach allows me to cultivate relationships with new ideas and people through staying curious with outlooks from different lenses while making decisions that is free from prejudice. Also, being disciplined in nature, once I have a goal in mind, I often streamline my way on getting there.  
        <br>
        <br>
          However, I noticed when in environments that maintain conversations that are unreasonably divisive in nature, I feel inhibited in working to my fullest potential. It is important that I contribute to a learning or working environment that encourages the capacity to learn from one another and is inviting of change and perspectives. Additionally, it is necessary for me to derive meaning from, and to be able to see the bigger picture when working on a task, else my interest in the task at hand is short-lived. 
        </p>

      <h4>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles</h4>
        <p>
          An open-mind and being disciplined will ease my capacity to persist in study as well as adapt to differences and changes in the environment. It is inescapable that through this learning journey, there will be areas that do not play to my strengths, but maintaining an open-mind to remind myself to keep going  and look at issues from a different angle will ultimately fortify and enrich my resilience.
