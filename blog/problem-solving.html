    <h3>Problem & Solution</h3>
    <p>
      Sprint 4's JS Kata exercise: Built-in Methods, whereAreYou. 
      I was stuck on this problem for a long time as I could not come to understand
      what the task listed in the console was looking for. 
      I soon realised that there were instructions in the EDA handbook and a massive hint 
      for what method the challenge was after. I was only looking at the hints in the console 
      before this, not realising there was more information to base off of.
      Additionally, the challenge at hand was suggesting to use a new method, one that I had 
      not used before, so I googled and used the <strong>MDN Wed Docs</strong> as a primary resource to understand
      the syntax (the structure of the method). 
      I still had to look at different resources such as <strong>w3schools</strong> and  
      <strong>javascripttutorial</strong> to fully grasp how it may be applied to different situations.
      I then tested my understanding on the console to see what results it returned and after a many error messages,
      it made alot more sense. After multiple rounds of hair pulling, I finally got it to run! 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was definitely a frustrating moment and the fault was all mine of course!
      The moment I realised I missed reading the main point of the task, it was a mix of hooray! and 
      ðŸ¤¦. 
    </p>
    <h3>Lesson learnt</h3>
    <p>
    I could have saved alot of time had I read through the instructions beforehand. 
    Strange, as I am normally someone who tends towards over-reading before jumping into things
    and one of my goals to achieve at the end of the bootcamp, is to do be more selective in what I read
    and invest more time in action. However, in this case, it somewhat backfired. 
    Moving forward, I will try find a balance between the two. Lesson has been learnt!
    </p>
    <h3>Problem Solving Techniques I use:</h3>
    <p>
      <u>Pseudocode</u>
      <br> I find pseudocode extremely helpful in structuring what path to take when writing code
      and a point of reference when returning back to code that was written in the past. 
      Especially when I am learning a new concept or have struggled with something, I ensure to 
      break down the steps in a clear and concise way because there would be a high chance I forget 
      how to do it later down the line.
    </p>

    <p>
      <u>Trying something, Console.logging, Reading error messages & Googling</u>
      <br> I often do a test run the console to gauge my core understanding of a piece of code 
      and this has been part of my process thus far. I have yet to fully understand the error messages 
      when I see them prima facie, however a quick google or search on stackoverflow tends to clarify them. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <u>Rubber ducky method</u>
      <br> While I have often used this process as a means to help me understand something,
      I did not realise there was a coined term for it, until now! 
      I do find myself talking outloud to myself when I have reached a roadblock 
      and while I write my psuedocode out. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <u>Asking your peers for help & Asking coaches for help</u>
      <br>I am comfortable asking questions and seeking for help when needed.
      I anticipate there will be many questions coming once bootcamp begins!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <u>Improving your process with reflection</u>
      I do find that reflective writing has helped me pay more attention to my strengths, weaknesses and 
      goals during this time. I find prompts a good starting point to dump my thoughts and refine what 
      I aim to convey in a manner that is honest, concise and constructive.
