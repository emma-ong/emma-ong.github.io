      <p>
        To have emotional intelligence, means to have the ability, capacity, skill or the self-perceived skill in:
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>monitoring and regulating one’s own and the feelings and emotions of others,</li>
          <li>discriminating amongst information recieved,</li>
          <li>utilising the information to facilitate how one thinks and acts</li>

      <h2 class="center">IQ</h2>
      <p>
        The Intelligence Quotient (IQ), is a result or score that is obtained from 
        one of multiple standardized tests that measures human intelligence. 
        IQ is conventionally utilised to measure giftedness or the likelihood 
        of one’s success and accomplishments and can be found in decision making within areas of recruitment. 
        The assessment looks at the capability of an individual’s:
        <ul>
          <li>observation,</li>
          <li>analytical,</li>
          <li>and interpretational skills of a situation.</li>
        </ul>  
         
      </p>

       <h2 class="center">Importance of EQ</h2>
       <p>Through the development of EQ, one sets themselves up for success 
         in one’s own productivity as well as the productivity of others. 
         Within the process of developing EQ, there are components that lead to: 
        <ul>
          <li>stress reduction on a micro and macro scale (e.g an employee's reduction in stress could lead to greater outcomes for the individual as well as their employer or organisation)</li>
          <li>prepare individuals for potential conflicts and how to moderate them </li>
          <li>healthier relationships are developed through the promotion of understanding between the parties involved</li>
          <li>a fostering of harmonious, continuous and balanced environments </li>
          <li>individuals having more opportunity to explore concepts what gives them meaning</li>
        </ul>
