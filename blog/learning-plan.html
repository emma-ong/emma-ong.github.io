        <h2><u>Foundations</u></h2>
        <h2>Long-term Career Goal</h2>
          <p>
          My long term goal is to acquire the necessary skills
          enabling me to become a self-sufficient developer.
          </p>

        <h2>Learning: Strengths & Limitations</h2>
          <p>
          I am disciplined and naturally find myself developing healthier and productive habits. 
          These range from 30-day lifestyle challenges to improving my gameplay on certain PC/mobile characters. 
          Most recently, I have been working towards doing my first pull-upâ€¦ and holy cow, am I on struggle street! 
          That said, I really enjoy the process of being a beginner in things, being humbled by that realisation and putting myself to work. 
          This process will be very helpful as a student in web development. 
         <br>
          However, there are moments where I catch myself thinking a little too hard on what should be done, 
          rather than jumping straight into it and figuring out the kinks as I go. 
          This is something that I have been mindful of as a learner and strive to do more of when the opportunity arises. 
          </p>

        <h2>Human Skills to be developed at EDA</h2>
          <p>
            To be more self-compassionate 
            and learn how to communicate technical-oriented ideas 
            in a more accessible and engaging manner. 
          </p>

          <h4>A commitment on managing workload and self</h4>
           <p>
            Keeping to my morning ritual which includes moving the body, 
            do a quick clean of the home 
            and giving lots of love to Mochi <i class="fa-solid fa-paw"></i>
            <br>
            This ensures I start the day with a clean slate and feel the productive buzz for the rest of my schedule.  
            <br>
            <br>
            I use the app, Notion, to tick-off my objectives as I complete them 
            and highlight anything to go over once more if I was not feeling 
            super comfortable with a concept just yet. 
            <br>
            <br>
            In terms of the hours spent on the course, I spend the days like I would in a full-time role,
            while prioritizing rest and sleep. 
          </p>
          <h4>A commitment to the community</h4>
            <p>
              Engaging in activities mindfully and honestly 
              whilst also ensuring that this journey is also about 
              developing fruitful connections and relationships.  
            </p>

          <h4>A commitment to seek help </h4>
            <p>
              As someone who at times feels like they're bothersome when asking for help, 
              is a sentiment I am aware of and a frame of mind that requires some shifting. 
              I tend towards doing things independently but know that too much of anything has diminishing returns. 
              I will be mindful of how much time is spent working on a problem, 
              and when the time comes, reach out and find a time that works for all parties to come up with a solution.
            </p>
        <h2>Expectations: Facilitation Team</h2>
          <p>
            I hope the team dedicate a reasonable amount of their attention and time to listen to possible issues if they were to be encountered. 
            While there is no expectation they will have all the answers, 
            having a productive conversation around the issue would help me feel supported. 
          </p>
        <h2>Scheduling info and other commitments</h2>
          <p>
            I have made myself available to attend the hours for this course 
            and may on occasion need to attend to family matters. 
            If there are any sudden changes, I will notify the team as soon as I can.
