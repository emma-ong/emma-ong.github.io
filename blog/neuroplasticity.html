    <h3>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h3>
    <p>
      Understanding the influence we can have on our brain development 
      and its malleability, can allow ourselves to engage and redirect 
      our efforts into challenging our mind, body and the way we learn. 
      We would be better suited to develop strategies to facilitate 
      in enhancing our wellbeing such as taking part in and 
      seeking out activities that we haven’t tried before and are challenging. 
    </p>
    <h3>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</h3>
    <p>
      I would look into enriching my environment to establish a space 
      that encourages a higher level of focus, personalising the way 
      I learn to keep myself engaged on repetition and practice. 
      Quality sleep and rest is also an important factor 
      for growth in forming and strengthening the connections made in the brain, 
      improving its overall plasticity, hence I would look into ways of 
      maintaining a sleeping schedule and ensure I make my 
      space comfortable for deep rest. 
    </p>
    <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Learning a new skill like, which could a be a language, recipe, or how to play an instrument</li>
        <li>Visiting different parts of the world, this can include parts of your home country  </li>
        <li>Try doing things differently, such as taking a new route when commuting or eating with your less dominant hand</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      To draw further inspiration and to watch neuroplasticity in practice, 
      I stumbled across <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95NgtNgmnWA&list=PL-Saq7phAGKIWF2c9oMuFKvljICBi_1I5&ab_channel=NathanielDrew">Youtuber Nathaniel Drew</a>,
      and his journey on learning a new language.
   </p>
    <h3>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h3>
    <p>
      Fixed mindset
      <ul>
        <li>Believing that intelligence is not developable</li> 
        <li>Deems failure as a reflection of one’s intelligence</li>
        <li>Ignores feedback that is constructive</li>
        <li>Feels intimidated when others succeed </li>
        <li>Blames own failure on external factors such as the outcome of the actions by others </li>
      </ul> 
    </p>
    <p>
      Growth Mindset
      <ul>
        <li>Believing that intelligence is changeable</li>
        <li>Learns and grows from failure</li>
        <li>Views failure as a form of motivation to put in more effort in learning</li>
        <li>Leverages constructive feedback to improve self and others</li>
        <li>Does not blame others for their own failures 
          and looked for means to improve instead 
        </li>
      </ul>
      Relevance of a Growth Mindset
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>
          There is more emphasis on one's progress over being perfect. When pushed out of one's 
          comfort zone there is an understanding for those with a growth mindset,
          that improvements comes from effort and hard work, so the 
          main focus is the incremental changes in progress and the journey itself.
        </li>
        <li>
          Developing a growth mindset also puts one in a resilient position when
          it comes to dealing with obstacles and their reaction towards them. The practice of
          compassion and patience with oneself, irrespective of setbacks, creates a space where failures
          are part of the journey and fundamental in the achievement of personal and professional 
          growth. 
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
    <p>
      I learned about the fluidity of both fixed and growth mindsets, 
      and how they are points on a spectrum dependent on the situation. 
      For example, a student may find they have more of a fixed mindset 
      in their academic studies and but more of a growth mindset 
      in physical education classes. The ideal would be to adopt 
      a growth mindset in as many situations as possible, 
      though it would often be a persistent work in progress and a need 
      to have awareness of how their mindsets can influence their measure of success. 
    </p>
    <h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Being more mindful of the language I use and whether that pattern serves myself or my peers 
        </li>
        <li>To focus and be open to different solutions rather than dwelling on the same problem 
        </li>
        <li>Encouraging and reminding others and myself, at points of struggle and being overwhelmed, that the feeling is momentary and will pass 
        </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        I found the book <a href="https://www.robinsharma.com/book/the-5am-club">The 5AM Club by Robin Sharma</a>
            particularly engaging as it supports the idea that through a growth mindset, 
            one can change their life from reinventing their morning routine. 
    </p>
    <h3>Blend with your learning plan and strategies: 
      Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or 
      influence your learning plan and strategy</h3>
    
    <p>
      The most palpable critic is often oneself, 
      and l often find myself in a space where I feel the need to cut short 
      the moments of celebration when something clicks rather than fully embracing the lightbulb that has gone off. 
      I will be more mindful of being kinder to myself and allow myself to celebrate the small wins that I have. 
      I will also ensure that I am resting well and stick to a consistent exercise regime, 
      to fortify my capacity to learn and ensure that 
      I maintain a healthy physical and mental foundation in order to persist in my learning journey.
