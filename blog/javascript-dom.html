        <h2>HTML - Cat Skeleton</h2>
        <img class="cat-images" src="../images/skull.png" alt="img via fontawesome">
        <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a language 
          that acts as the foundation of a website’s content and structure, 
          such as how a cat’s skeleton holds its’ innards together 
          and a base to connect its bodily systems.    </p>

        <img class="cat-images" src="../images/orangecat.png" alt="img via fontawesome">
        <p>
          While a cat’s skeleton acts as the foundation for its body, 
          Cascading Style sheets (CSS) acts as a cat’s fur coat. 
          We use CSS to modify the aesthetic and the feel component of a website, 
          as this is what we can use to define schemes of colours, font, alignment and so forth.

          <img class="cat-images" src="../images/bad.png" alt="img via fontawesome">
          <p>As a programming language, Javascript’s (JS) role is to give a set of instructions of a computer to do something, 
            like how a cat will meow when they might want something from their human or hiss in fear, 
            when they want to be left alone. 
            Instead of telling humans what to do, we are taking control of a computer through providing it with written statements.

          <h2>Control Flow - Cat routine</h2>
          <img class="cat-images" src="../images/clock.png" alt="img via fontawesome">
          <p>A house cat tends to be a creature of routine, 
            sticking to a schedule that has been set either by themselves or their human, 
            and like JS, there is something called a control flow, which describes how a computer runs its code directionally, 
            from top to bottom. A cat might hunt at night and sleep during the day. When JS code runs, 
            it begins from the first line and ends at the last. A routine, however, can be interrupted,
             such as how a program’s control flow can change. 
             A change can be caused by things called loops or functions, 
             which influence the control flow. 
          </p>

          <h2>Loops - Cat Naps</h2>
          <img class="cat-images" src="../images/loop.png" alt="img via favicon">
          <p>Cats are also known to sleep up to 18 hours a day and can be considered lazy in comparison to other animals. 
            When we write code, it is important to harness your inner cat and be as lazy as possible…hold your furballs, let me explain!
            In programming, we can leverage the computer’s speed to run one or many instruction(s) at a time rather than doing this manually. 
            This is where loops come in handy.  
            For example, if we wanted the computer to display all numbers from 0 to 100, 
            we would write a task for the computer to perform a sequence and to stop running, 
            once it met a certain condition (e.g. once the computer has reached 100).

          <h2>DOM - Cat VR</h2>
          <img class="cat-images" src="../images/map.png" alt="img via favicon">
          <img class="cat-images" src="../images/catface.png" alt="img via favicon">

          <p>
            While HTML, CSS and JS are declarative in nature, 
            the Document Object Model (DOM) is a means to utilise JavaScript to alter our HTML, 
            which allows us to build websites that are dynamic and display motion or behaviours on the front-end, 
            how a user may navigate within or interact with a website. 
            The DOM represents the actual structure of the page. 

            If HTML and CSS are like a cat’s skeleton and coat, 
            while JS is like a cat’s behaviour, 
            then the DOM can be represented by a dynamic map of a cat’s past, 
            present and plan for its future. 
            Let’s add another metaphor, and imagine the cat was a modifiable character in a virtual world, 
            we would be able to navigate the DOM as though we were in an edit mode in this virtual reality, 
            where we could alter the cat’s state, 
            by changing its appearance or behaviours.

          <h2>Arrays - List of Fur Friends</h2>
          <img class="cat-images" src="../images/list.png" alt="img via favicon">
          <p>
            A cat is an intelligent being, and like humans, it remembers things. 
            Like humans, they may not remember everything accurately, 
            such as when meeting new humans and other cats. 
            If a cat wanted to keep track of those it comes across, 
            they could use something called an array, 
            which works like a sorted list – the items in this list are in positions called an index.
            An index is a numeric label of the position of an item in an array. 
            The first item in an array begins with 0 and not 1. The next item on the list will be 1, and then 2 and so on.
            We can give this list a name to call upon it later in time, 
            this is equivalent to storing the list in a variable and a list is just one of the many things a variable can store, 
            so that we can retrieve it later.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="cat5">
          <h2>Arrays - Example</h2>

          <h2>Objects - Details about Fur Friends</h2>
          <img class="cat-images" src="../images/files.png" alt="img via favicon">
          <p>
            For a simple list, arrays are helpful, however, 
            cats rely heavily on scents and other cues to remember their friends, 
            so let’s say our cat needed more information to tell their friends part, 
            we could store these details in an ‘object’ and other details along with it. 
            Here are some examples below: 
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="cat7">
          <h2>Objects - Example</h2>

          <h2>Functions - Cat Servant</h2>
          <img class="cat-images" src="../images/happycat.png" alt="img via favicon">
          <img class="cat-images" src="../images/family.png" alt="img via favicon">
          <p>House cats might sometimes look to their family members for different purposes, 
            such as human1 normally provides their meals, 
            human2 tends to clean their litter and human3 has a warm lap to sit on, 
            each human serving their unique function. 
            In JS, functions are a type of value and do what their called to do, 
            serve a function, or has a specific purpose when called upon. 
            For example, JS has a function called ‘push’ that adds an element to the end of an array. 
            This type of function that can be embedded at the end of an array, are specifically called methods. 
            Let’s see it in action here:
