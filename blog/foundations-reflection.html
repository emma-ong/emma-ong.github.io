    <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h2>
    <p> 
      Learning through and reflecting on the journey, has really stressed
      that it is natural to have blindspots and it can sometimes be more important to learn by testing and tinkering rather than
      expecting an end result from the first attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have also noticed that during the first few weeks of foundations, I was hyperfocussed on the 
      aesthetic appeal of my projects. While I found and still find this aspect fun and engaging, it was 
      not long until I realised, that I was trying to 'perfect' every detail before I called it a week. 
      This meant that I spent a great deal of time dwelling on the finer details, rather than letting myself rest. While it is a process
      is enjoyable, I do need to be more mindful of how much time I spend on code rather than going down the rabbit hole for each tackled detail. 
    </p>
    <p>
     Furthermore, I noticed that I enjoyed the technical components much more than I enjoyed writing reflections at the beginning of foundations. 
     There were a few topics that I had not truly sat down to ponder on before so there was a gradual shift in appreciation 
     for not only learning how to do something, but also documenting that journey to investigate further about learning itself. 

    </p>
    <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
    <p>It gives us the tools to try and understand ourselves which help us understand others. 
      This insight provides us with a positive direction to improve ourselves and achieve our goals. 
    </p>
    <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
    <p>
     That I find myself paying more attention to my mindset much more and whether it is serving me in moments of 
     how I react to situations or problems. 
    </p>
    <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
    <p>
      Putting to practice what I learnt within the core learning. For example, learning about growth mindsets is one thing,
      but when in moments of frustration, practicing this is not always available to us. However, I can already feel a shift more
      and more each day, when I remind myself that these moments will pass. 

    <h2>Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h2>
    <p>
      At the end of the day, whether we decide to work for ourselves or an employer, people will always be involved in 
      the work that we do. Programming is as much as the development of relationships as it is developement of websites. 
    </p>
    <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
    <p>As above, I did prefer to do the technical challenges much more than writing about how I went about it and the things I learnt through the way.
      This was only because the core learning made me really have to think and process things about myself, while with code, it felt less personal. 
      I do very much appreciate what the core learning has taught me and I will be taking the teachings on with me, not solely
      through bootcamp, and my career, but in my daily life as well.
